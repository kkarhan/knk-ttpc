"0123 Concept Cipher"


Main Idea:
	Build an encryption system that fulfulls all of Kerckhoff's principle*s, but is not the Miller-Vernam-Mauborgne "One Time Pad" aka. "individual Worm".
	
Those are:
	*	Basic indecipherability
	*	The cryptosystem does not require secrecy of it's functionality
	*	only key secrecy
	*	Easy transferability of the system with easy to memorize keys
	*	Compactibility with telegraphy [or electronic transmission]
	*	Portability and easy to use
	*	Easy application of they system
	Bonus:
	*	Fulfills Fano-Condition
